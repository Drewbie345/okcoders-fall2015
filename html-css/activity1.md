HTML Activity #1
================

1. Create an unordered list with 4 list items (Google, Yahoo, Twitter, Facebook) that link to their respective URLs using the `<a href>` tag.

2. Your mission: Create a bio web page about yourself.

Below are some HTML tags that you can use to get started. Use Google to find 3 tags that I haven't listed and use those as well. 

````html
<html>
<head>
<body>
<p>
<h1>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>
<img />
<br />
<div>
<header>
<nav>
<footer>
````

Questions to consider:

1. What is the difference between block elements and inline elements? Give examples of each.

2. What does the `<div>` tag do?

3. What does the `<!DOCTYPE html>` tell the browser?
