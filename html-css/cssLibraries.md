1. [SpinKit - Simple CSS Spinners](http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/)
2. [WOW.js](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/)
3. [Superscrolloroma](http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/) - This one uses a bit of JS
4. [Hint.css](http://kushagragour.in/lab/hint/)
5. [BTNS](http://mrmrs.io/btns/)

Your Assignment
---

1. Pick a library you would like to focus on! If it's not on the list above, that's totally okay!

2. Create a demo page that shows the class what the library you picked can do.
	* Create an HTML file. Link the CSS library files to that HTML file. 
	* Write some HTML/CSS (and potentially a little JS code) that creates an example of the CSS library in action.
