HTML Project - Recreate a Site
==============================

Instructions:
-------------

Take a look at the jpeg file called eterna.jpg. Your mission is to recreate this static site using your knowledge of HTML and CSS (and your ability to Google what you don't know!).

Focus on recreating the layout (if you need to use different icons/colors/etc. that's fine). I've included images in this folder that you can use or choose your own.

If you would like me to review your code, please send me a zipped folder of your site (including all necessary images/files) and I will take a look!
