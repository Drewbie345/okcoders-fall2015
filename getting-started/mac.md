You must be running Mac OS 10.8 Mountain Lion or better, including Yosemite. Check what version of the Mac OS you have installed by clicking on the Apple menu item at the top left of your screen and selecting *About this Mac*.

If you must upgrade your computer, follow the instructions at [apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade](http://www.apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade/).

Also ensure that you have installed the latest updates. Again click on the *Apple* menu item at select *Software Update*.

## Install Software

Install the following software by downloading it at these urls:

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

This is the free text editor we will be using in class. 

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/)

We will be doing all web development in Google Chrome because of its excellent developer tools.

An enhanced Terminal we'll learn to use.

## Install the Command Line Utilities

The Macintosh comes with a built-in command line interface called the *Terminal*. Launch it from your */Applications/Utilities* folder.

Install Apple's Command Line Tools: Instructions vary depending on which version of the Mac OS you are using. First try typing `gcc` at the command line. If a dialog box appears for installing the command line tools, *Install* them. You do not need to Install Xcode.

If the dialog box does not appear or you get an '*command not found*' error, it may be because you are running a slightly older version of the Mac OS. Download one of the following installers depending on your version of Mac OS. Double-click the completed download to install the files:
