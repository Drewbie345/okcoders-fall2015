JavaScript Activities #5
========================

UPDATE YOUR CODE - Exercise #1
------------------------------

Remember the restaurant reservation exercise from the first JS Activity? Today, you will refactor your code to incorporate some of the JS concepts we've been learning.

INSTRUCTIONS (again!)
---------------------

Write a simplified restaurant reservation directory. See instructions below.

  * Assign three variables to three different names (We'll call each of these a reservation).

  * Prompt the user for a name.

  * If the name is a reservation, welcome the user and mark the reservation as claimed.

  * If the name is a claimed reservation, tell the user that reservation has already been taken.

  * Otherwise, tell the user they need to make a reservation.

  RESTRICTIONS: You must use text inputs and display text on the page instead of using prompt/alert windows!

You may use whatever JavaScript knowledge you have/or can google to accomplish this. There's definitely opportunities to use functions here (hint, hint!).
